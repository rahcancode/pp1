        <div><h2>Welcome To Your Village</h2> 
        <p>This website was born out of the experience I had with my first baby during the pandemic.
            While preparing to have my son, often there was either too much or too little information available. When he arrived earlier than expected, I found it challenging to navigate all the resources online, especially while scrolling one handed on my phone and sleep deprived.
            This page is a "quick start guide" with some resources that might help another parent like me.</p>

                <p>
                    Life has changed as you know it. The HSE website is chock full of useful information for before baby arrives, and after. 
                    The "Life With A Newborn" page has a helpful video for this new stage in your journey, as well as some advice on how your relationship with your partner may change, how to look after yourself, and how to ask for help.

                <p>
                    During the pandemic, The Rotunda Hospital, Dublin, created a series of Parent Education videos in lieu of in person classes. 
                    Here they cover everything from antenatal classes, labour & birth, infant feeding, baby care & going home. 
                    They also have some videos on antenatal and postpartum physio exercises too.

                <p>
                    Not everyone is able to chestfeed their newborn.
                    With huge pressure that "breast is best", and a stigma around bottle feeding immediately, there isn't much information around exclusively pumping and combo feeding your baby. 
                    This website is packed with useful information around all things breast pumps, how to safely store breast milk, how to use breast milk and formula together, along with a lot of really good content on feeding your child through many stages.

                <p>
                    What To Expect gives a detailed month by month guide on the growth and development of your baby. You may have used this during pregnancy to see how baby was growing inside the bump, but there are even more milestones to meet once they have arrived.
